# IpScanner

Keeps checking the IP address of server it is installed on and sends notification if the IP changes. This is useful when the server's IP changes over time .i.e. the server's IP address is not reserved.

The problem I had was, I was serving different services for my home via my router however Public IP address for my home was changing. So I made this program to help me keep track of changing IP addresses.
